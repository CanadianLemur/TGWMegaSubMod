 MSMChina.1.t:0 "A New Republic"
 MSMChina.1.d:0 "After a violent revolution, the Republic reigns supreme! As per the surrender deal we gave Yuan Shikai we must give him a term president of the Republic.

 MSMChina.3.t:0 "The Election of Yuan Shikai"
 MSMChina.3.d:0 "Yuan Shikai has been pressing his claim to the presidency more and more lately. He backing his claim to the presidency with military force. We should probably give him what he wants or he will destroy the republic that we worked so hard to build. He would also like to move the capital to Nanjing to Beijing."
 MSMChina.3.a:0 "We will have to accept his demands"
 MSMChina.3.b:0 "§R-NOT DONE-§! That rat will never be president!"
 MSMChina.4.t:0 "The First Democratic Elections"
 MSMChina.4.d:0 "The first democratic elections have come at last! Following the very undemocratic election of Yuan Shikai last year, we finally have the chance for the voices of our people to be heard. The man running against Shikai is Song Jiaoren, a member of the Kuomintang. He is very likely to win against Shikai in the election."
 MSMChina.4.a:0 "Let's hope he does"
 MSMChina.5.t:0 "Song Jiaoren is killed!"
 MSMChina.5.d:0 "Just weeks after the beginning of his campaign for president, Song Jiaoren was assassinated by a lone gunman. This gunman has been linked to men loyal to Yuan Shikai. However, following their subsequent deaths and disappearences, we have no evidence to put Shikai on trial or remove him from office."
 MSMChina.5.a:0 "A shame"
