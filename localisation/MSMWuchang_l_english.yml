The revolution consisted of many revolts and uprisings. The turning point is the Wuchang Uprising on October 10 1911, that was a result of the mishandling of the Railway Protection Movement. The revolution ended with the abdication of the Last Emperor Puyi on February 12 1912, that marked the end of over 2000 years of Imperial China and the beginning of China's Republican era."
