 TRIUMPH_OF_GERMANY_NAME:0 "Triumph of Germany"
 TRIUMPH_OF_GERMANY_DESC:0 "§RAlternate History§!\nThe Weltkrieg has finally come to an end. The Central Powers have emerged victorious, A quick end to the eastern front and the opening of an Indian front through Afghanistan and Persia brought a quick end to the two most potent sources of manpower the Entente had,\n "
 GER_THE_AFTERMATH_OF_VERSAILLES_DESC:0 "With the collapse of the German Empire, its shadow, the Weimar Republic, has taken its place in Europe. The new government is plagued by a crippled industry, heavy reparations, and most notably, constant conflicts between Communists and the autocratic Freikorps which threaten to tear the country into civil war.\n\n Few are happy with the status quo. If the Republic does not stabilize itself soon, it may meet the same fate as the Germany of 1848."
