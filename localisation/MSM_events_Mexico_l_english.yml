 MSMMexico.2.t:0 "Madero Arrested!"
 MSMMexico.2.d:0 "Following fears that Madero would make a sudden change in policy, Porfirio Díaz has had Francisco Madero jailed. What this will do for the election is uncertain, however this most certainly has increased tensions among members of the Anti-Re-election Movement. The possibility of civil war is increasing!"
