 ww1_sweden.7.t:0"A new Capital?"
 ww1_sweden.7.d:0"With the formation of Scandinavia we have a unique opportunity to choose a new capital for our new country, while we could keep it in Stockholm, that could cause anxiety amongst the other members of the union, some have suggested we move the capital to Goteborg, a central location between Sweden, Denmark and Norway, we could also put the capital in Kristiana if we want to balance power in the union by putting the capital in the weakest member, Copenhagen is another option, its strategic location in the straits and closeness to Germany offers many economic opportunities, however it is very vulnerable, lastly we could put the capital in Helsinki if we want to appease the Finns, however this will not be well recieved in the rest of the union"
