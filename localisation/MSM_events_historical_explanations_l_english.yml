 MSM_historical_explanations.1.d:0 "You start off the game with William Howard Taft as your President. This becomes the jumping off point for most of the events that will take place up to and including WWI, and the course of the country afterward. There are four main routes you can take that are all centered on the President chosen in the 1912 elections.\n\nThe first route, the historical route of Woodrow Wilson, is achieved by maintaining medium (~50%) support from both the Progressives and the Conservatives, and specifically choosing the \"Go after US Steel\" and \"Our Own Men\" focuses while going down the Broken Party tree. These focuses will make Teddy Roosevelt very angry, causing him to run against you on his own Bull Moose platform following the completion of the \"The Question of the Republican Nomination\" focus, splitting the vote and thus giving the win to Woodrow Wilson.\n\nThe second route is to have Theodore Roosevelt win the election. This is done by completely losing the support of the Progressives and angering Teddy by doing the two focuses listed previously. This will cause the same order of events as before, however upon the completion of the \"The Question of the Republican Nomination\" focus, Teddy will emerge victorious and become the primary candidate for the Republican party, and winning him the election.\n\nThe third route, Taft's reelection, is achieved simply by maintaining support from both the Progressives and the Conservatives. In this case, angering Teddy will still factor into whether or not he tries to run for the Republican nomination, however he will not try to run third party and will instead concede to Taft, causing him to win Reelection.\n\nThe fourth and final path is the Eugene V. Debs path. This is accomplished by maintaining low support from both parties, and not angering Teddy. This will cause Teddy not to run against Taft, however the parties will still hate him and put up another candidate. This will cause Eugene V. Debs to win the Republican nomination instead, and will win him the election."

 MSM_historical_explanations.2.t:0 "Germany Historical & Alt History Explanation"
 MSM_historical_explanations.2.d:0 "You start off in a very strong place, with Germany being the dominant power in Europe. However, your military staff is full of in-fighting and rivalries. Their main division is what to do in the event of war with France. Should they make use of the - now updated - Schlieffen plan, or the plan thought up by Paul von Hindenburg? Should you wish to go with the Schlieffen plan, you will follow the historical route of Germany, fighting the Entente alongside Austria-Hungary and the Ottomans. Should you choose to go with the Hindenburg plan, you have the option of replacing von Falkenhayn with Eric von Ludendorff, having him create his own political faction that will try to take power from the Kaiser and put it in the hands of von Ludendorff. This path will allow you to still fight the Entente, however first you will have the option to declare the Second Brothers war on Austria-Hungary. Following this first war, you will have the option to fully annex Austria-Hungary, or annex only the German lands and establish Hungarian and Croation puppet states. This path will have your ideology flip to Proto-Fascist, and will cause you issues if you do not willingly give power back to the Kaiser following the calming of tensions in Europe after all the wars are over.

 MSM_historical_explanations.2.t:0 "Mexico Historical & Alt History Explanation"
 MSM_historical_explanations.2.d:0 "You start off in a difficult situation, with long-time president, Porfirio Diaz, who has maintained a political and economic status quo for decades being apposed by a movement of various revolutionaries united in stopping his re-election. You can stay down the historical path as Franciso Madero, leader of the anti-re-election movement as he fights a civil war and works to build a new government. His presidency will be diffiult with his fellow revolutionaries becoming impatient with the slow progress of his reforms. As Madero run his government, the parliment opposes his reforms and the military plans its betrayal. Historically, Madero is killed by Victoriano Huerta, the commander in charge of the defence of Mexico City, who launches a coup against him and seizes control of Mexico. Huerta seeks to militarize mexico to protect it from foreign economic entanglement, nationalizing Mexican resources such as oil. Depending on the president, the USA will not see Huerta as a legitimate ruler of Mexico and may seek to install a new president, or enforce American resource rights on Mexico. If done correctly, the Madero/Huerta path can bring economic prosperity to Mexico. The Diaz Path, is a path that supports foreign economic interests. Diaz will initially try to maintain the status quo, but will either die or retire to leave a new successor, who may perhaps go for a new Mexican economic system to better please the populace, in the event that revolts and attempted revolutions become too much."
