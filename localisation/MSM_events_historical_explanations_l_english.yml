 MSM_historical_explanations.1.d:0 "You start off the game with William Howard Taft as your President. This becomes the jumping off point for most of the events that will take place up to and including WWI, and the course of the country afterward. There are four main routes you can take that are all centered on the President chosen in the 1912 elections. The first route, the historical route of Woodrow Wilson, is achieved by maintaining medium (~50%) support from both the Progressives and the Conservatives, and specifically choosing the \"Go after US Steel\" and \"Our Own Men\" focuses while going down the Broken Party tree. These focuses will make Teddy Roosevelt very angry, causing him to run against you on his own Bull Moose platform following the completion of the \"The Question of the Republican Nomination\" focus, splitting the vote and thus giving the win to Woodrow Wilson.\nThe second route is to have Theodore Roosevelt win the election. This is done by completely losing the support of the Progressives and angering Teddy by doing the two focuses listed previously. This will cause the same order of events as before, however upon the completion of the \"The Question of the Republican Nomination\" focus, Teddy will emerge victorious and become the primary candidate for the Republican party, and winning him the election. The thrid route, Taft's reelection, is achieved simply by maintaining support from both the Progressives and the Conservatives. In this case, angering Teddy will still factor into whether or not he tries to run for the Republican nomination, however he will not try to run third party and will instead concede to Taft, causing him to win Reelection. The fourth and final path is the Eugene V. Debs path. This is accomplished by maintaining low support from both parties, and not angering Teddy. This will cause Teddy not to run against Taft, however the parties will still hate him and put up another candidate. This will cause Eugene V. Debs to win the Republican nomination instead, and will win him the election."
