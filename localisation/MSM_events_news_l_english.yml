 MSM_news.1.t:0"The Fall of Paris"
 MSM_news.1.d:0"Despite valiant defensive efforts by Entente forces, Paris has fallen into German hands once again, dealing a devastating blow to French morale.\n\nLike in 1870, Germany avoided direct confrontations by shelling defensive positions in the city. Entente forces launched several counterattacks, which ultimately proved fruitless.\n\nThough [FRA.GetLeader] has urged his people to fight on, most believe the fall of the City of Lights spells the end of the war effort."

 MSM_news.2.t:0"The Fall of Marseille"
 MSM_news.2.d:0"With the departure of the last French ships from the Fos Port and the raising of the German flag over the Palais Longchamp, the battle for France's oldest city has come to a close.\n\nThough attacks from the north were successfully stalled by heavy Entente defenses, repeated assaults from the Stoßtruppen were ultimately able to overtake trench lines to the city's east, forcing the retreating defenders out into the Occitan countryside.\n\nThe capture of Marseille by [GER.GetNameDef] has not only deprived the Entente of perhaps their most important port on the Mediterranean, but has also physically split France from Italy, something that could change the balance of the conflict dramatically."
