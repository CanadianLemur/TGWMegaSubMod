 MSMUSA.3.d:0 "In 1912 Woodrow Wilson ran on the platform of 'New Freedom' which denounced what Wilson perceived as both Theodore Roosevelt's more paternalistic and collectivist New Nationalism as well as William Howard Taft's conservatism. A 'Bouban Democrat' Wilson promised lower tariffs, free trade, and trust breaking in his speeches, though the Progressive movement would encourage him to enact a more moderate form of Roosevet's proposals through the creation of a Federal Reserve and supprt for the income tax. While some of these policies might be costly in the short term in the long term they would both help keep consumers protected from economic recessions and make goods less expensive,' satisfying the populace for the moment."
