 MSM_news.1.d:0"Despite valiant defensive efforts by Entente forces, Paris has fallen into German hands once again, dealing a devastating blow to French morale.\n\nLike in 1870, Germany avoided direct confrontations by shelling defensive positions in the city. Entente forces launched several counterattacks, which ultimately proved fruitless.\n\nThough [FRA.GetLeader] has urged his people to fight on, most believe the fall of the City of Lights spells the end of the war effort."
