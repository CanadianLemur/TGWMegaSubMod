 GER_ww1_war_plans_division_1_desc:0"Germany has always had the strongest military theories. We must ensure that this fact does not change, and create an active board of military theorists that will create a plan for every scenario."
 GER_ww1_war_plans_schlieffen_plan:0"The Schlieffen Plan"
 GER_ww1_war_plans_schlieffen_plan_desc:0"The famed general von Schlieffen has devised a plan to march through the Low Countries to breach the French lines quickly, followed by a march eastward in the event of an Entente war. This plan was devised many years ago however, and could do with some updating. General Helmuth von Moltke seems perfect for the job."
 GER_ww1_war_plans_replace_the_g88:0"Replace the G88"
 GER_ww1_war_plans_replace_the_g88_desc:0"The Gewehr 88 has long since been the standard for our infantry. However this is an old design, having been out-performed by more up-to-date rifles.

 GER_ww1_war_plans_mobile_howitzer_desc:0"The Howitzer has proved itself to be a boon of modern warfare, however its portability leaves much to be desired. If we are to make full use of a more rapid advance, these howitzers must come with us. Perhaps some kind of motor vehicle would do the trick..."

 GER_ww1_war_plans_war_games_desc:0"A man can sit at the head of his grand table, blathering on about tactics until the hearth dies low and still be no better off than he began. If we are to truly prepare for conflict, our plans cannot be mere conjecture. We must thoroughly test our military theories to truly gain an edge."
 GER_ww1_war_plans_whip_up_the_reserves:0"Whip up the Reserves"
 GER_ww1_war_plans_whip_up_the_reserves_desc:0"A General is just a man in fancy clothes without an army to lead. If we are to lead an army, we must find the manpower reserves to create it."

 GER_ww1_war_plans_fortify_the_eastern_front_desc:0"In order to focus the bulk of our forces on a rapid conquest of France, we will have to be able to hold the Russian line with less. To that end, we shall make the defense of the Russian line an issue of material, not men."
 GER_ww1_war_plans_front_line_reports:0"Front Line Reports"
 GER_ww1_war_plans_front_line_reports_desc:0"Our men on the Western front have informed us of the French military positions. Perhaps we can gather more of this intel and use it to our advantage."
 GER_ww1_war_plans_prepare_for_arial_combat:0"Prepare for Arial Combat"
 GER_ww1_war_plans_prepare_for_arial_combat_desc:0"Though they are new technology, aircraft have proved themselves useful for reconnaissance. Perhaps we might be able to integrate them further into military movements if we gave them basic armaments?"

 GER_ww1_war_plans_prepare_for_rapid_advance_desc:0"As each day passes, the likelihood of war seems more of a certainty than a possibility. We cannot allow ourselves to be caught with our pants down.

 GER_ww1_war_plans_deal_with_the_swiss_desc:0"Though the Swiss have stayed neutral in past conflicts, in this age of blood and iron neutrality becomes harder and harder to tolerate. Perhaps if we ask nicely, they will let us through."
 GER_ww1_war_plans_deal_with_the_low_countries:0"Deal with the Low Countries"
 GER_ww1_war_plans_deal_with_the_low_countries_desc:0"We cannot ignore any potential French border, even if that border is not shared by us both. The plan from the beginning has always been to invade through the Low Countries, but we haven't decided whether those troop movements THROUGH them will be peaceful or not."
 GER_ww1_war_plans_finalize_preparations:0"Finalize Preparations"
 GER_ww1_war_plans_finalize_preparations_desc:0"We have toiled over these plans for many months. Now, with conflict on our doorstep, we have finally finished preparing for the eventuality of war. Let the powers of Europe do as they will, the German Empire will stand and fight!"

 GER_ww1_war_plans_forward_march:0"Forward March"
 GER_ww1_war_plans_forward_march_desc:0"We must have faith in the plan! This failiure is just a minor setback. We must break the stalemate and advance, even if it means a greater loss of life. If we simply continue to linger here, defeat will surely follow."
 GER_ww1_war_plans_dig_in:0"Dig In"
 GER_ww1_war_plans_dig_in_desc:0"This offensive has failed, but it is not without progress made. The Western front has stalled, so why not keep it that way?

 GER_ww1_war_plans_hindenburg_plan:0"Hindenburg Plan"
 GER_ww1_war_plans_hindenburg_plan_desc:0"Though we do have plans for a war with the Entente, they are rudimentary at best. With such an imposing force, we must gain all of the diplomatic advantages we can in order to tip the scales in our favor."
