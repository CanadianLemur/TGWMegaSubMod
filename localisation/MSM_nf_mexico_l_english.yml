 mex_thousand_year_porfiriato:0 "Thousand Year Profiriato"
 mex_thousand_year_porfiriato_desc:0 "Madero rallied countless members of the public and the military to his cause of an unjust rebellion, and despite all odds, Porfirio Diaz has crushed it! The Cientificos stand strong! The Porfiriato will rule forever!"
 mex_rebuild_el_norte:0 "Rebuild El Norte"
 mex_rebuild_el_norte_desc:0 "Madero's rebellion began in the north of the country, and most of the fighting took place there. Our rebuilding effort should start by restoring the communities and infrastructure there."
 mex_trial_maderistas:0 "Trial of Maderistas"
 mex_trial_maderistas_desc:0 "It is time for the enemies of the Porfiriato to face trial for their action. Our judges are prepared to follow our directions on who gets shot, jailed, or ''rehabilitated''. Of course, this is a big international story- the world will be watching..."
 mex_mexican_succession:0 "Mexican Succession"
 mex_mexican_succession_desc:0 "Okay, so it isn't really going to be a thousand years. Porfirio is growing old and tired, especially after the stress of the last war, and it is time to make a plan for his retirement and succession. His friends and advisors have some quite fascinating ideas!"
 mex_reyes_plan:0 "Reyes's Plan: 3rd Empire"
 mex_reyes_plan_desc:0 "Bernardo Reyes proposes establishing a Third Mexican Empire under the Diaz Dynasty, with himself as Prime Minister and true holder of power. Unfortunately, with Porifiro himself ailing, the only suitable candidate is Felixito, who may need to be...housebroken, for lack of a better term."
 mex_felix_austria:0 "Send Felix to Austria"
 mex_felix_austria_desc:0 "How can we mold Felix into less of an embarrassment and more of a proper noble gentleman? Simple! A trip to Hapsburg Austria to learn the ways of the old nobility. Acknowledging the Hapsburgs would also give our new Empire a nice sponsor and show our people we're quite serious about this."
 mex_vatican_detour:0 "Vatican Detour"
 mex_vatican_detour_desc:0 "A trip south into Italy will give Felix the opportunity both to meet with another country's aristocracy as well as meet and honor the Santo Padre himself in his ''jail'' in the Vatican. This will help drum up support with our more religious population." 
 mex_dignified_empire:0 "A Modern and Dignified Empire"
 mex_dignified_empire_desc:0 "Felix has shown himself to be capable and gentlemanly...enough, anyway. It is time to start showing him off to the public as a capable, almost-charming man, perfect for being the harmless face of a Bernardo Reyes shadow regime."
 mex_watchful_eye:0 "Under his Uncle's watchful eye"
 mex_watchful_eye_desc:0 "Of course, while Porfirio has never been very publicly fond of his ambitious nephew, if we are to legitimize Felix as a ''proper'' monarch, we must make it clear that, at least until the end of his life, Porfirio will be watching over him. Very closely."
 mex_huerta_plan:0 "Huerta Plan: The ''Coup''"
 mex_huerta_plan_desc:0 "Victoriano Huerta is one of the generals who fought with Madero, though he quickly fell back into the fold after the war. He has an interesting idea- an engineered ''coup'', which will put him on equal level with the President. This could be a great way out of a more unpopular regime..."
 mex_military_cientificos:0 "Military Cientificos"
 mex_military_cientificos_desc:0 "The Cientifico ideology is alive and well in our military, especially since most who've spoken out against it are currently hanging out in a jail cell or a gallow somewhere. Dealing them into the plan will give our ''coup'' a lot more legitimacy- and help keep more ambitious warlords out of the affair!"
 mex_preparing_coup_diaz:0 "Preparing the ''Coup''"
 mex_preparing_coup_diaz_desc:0 "The ''preparations'' are complete. All that needs to be done now is for our next regime of Military-Cientificos to state their case to the public. They will ''take power'' for the ''transition government'' to ''democracy''." 
 mex_president_in_distress:0 "President in Distress"
 mex_president_in_distress_desc:0 "Oh no! The President is about to be caught unaware in his private residence by a small squadron of army men and held hostage! And suspiciously, everyone else will be kept away from him while this happens! Whatever shall become of Mexico?"
 mex_passing_baton:0 "Passing the Baton"
 mex_passing_baton_desc:0 "And so, Porfirio Diaz recognizes the military regime, swears to avoid (public) interference with the new government, and promises to live out the rest of his life in his quietly in his lavish summer home in Veracruz sipping martinis and relaxing."
 mex_cut_out_middlemen:0 "Cut Out the Middlemen"
 mex_cut_out_middlemen_desc:0 "Rather than using our position to build up an elaborate shadow government with some kind of crazy scheme, we could always simply introduce the new leading figures of the Cientifico movement to the public, though they may find themselves lacking some legitimacy."
 mex_building_reyista_cabinet:0 "Building the Reyista Cabinet"
 mex_building_reyista_cabinet_desc:0 "Bernardo Reyes is the clear choice for Mexico's next President, so in addition to properly appointing him as Vice-President, we must begin to build up some of the other Cientifico figures around him, giving them some much-needed public visibility."
 mex_in_diaz_shadow:0 "In Porfirio's Shadow"
 mex_in_diaz_shadow_desc:0 "Porfirio Diaz still rules Mexico, and while he has little left to do, he has much to teach. Letting the Reyista cabinet shadow Diaz in his management of affairs will give them valuable insight into the practical side of what power is like."
 mex_new_generation:0 "The New Generation"
 mex_new_generation_desc:0 "The new Cientificos need more than just the public's approval and basic knowledge. Allowing them to preemptively stock the relevant positions of the Mexican government with their own choices will send a clear message: The future isn't now, necessarily, but it is soon."
 mex_greet_public:0 "Greet the Public"
 mex_greet_public_desc:0 "Hola, Mexico! Much of our population is already aware Bernardo Reyes is about to become president, and a larger portion even know who he is, but a whistle-stop tour through the countryside and a meet-and-greet with the citizenry should both make him a household name and endear him to the public."
 mex_adios_presidente:0 "Aidos, Presidente"
 mex_adios_presidente_desc:0 "The Thousand Year Porfiriato is over. Diaz has done everything he set out to do, and has earned his retirement. He will still have a hand in politics, likely until the day he dies, but for now, he can spend some well-deserved time on the beach, as his successors finally take the stage."
 mex_reestablishing_relations:0 "Re-Establishing Relations"
 mex_reestablishing_relations_desc:0 "Most of the world, notably the United States, recognized the Madero regime as the legal Mexican government, which is sort of a problem. This is an opportunity, however, to realign ourselves on this volatile world stage." 
 mex_making_amends:0 "Making Amends"
 mex_making_amends_desc:0 "There are two power blocs in the world right now, but actually reaching the Central Powers is a difficult enough affair that happily sucking up to the western democracies is probably a good idea- as long as they'll take us."
 mex_yankee_treaty:0 "A Treaty with the Yankees"
 mex_yankee_treaty_desc:0 "While Washington isn't completely tied to London or Paris, a friendly relationship with them is basically a requirement to make good with the Entente. A basic treaty normalizing relations and returning to the status quo will be good for our international presence and the economy."
 mex_an_in_with_a_dominion:0 "An in with a Dominion"
 mex_an_in_with_a_dominion_desc:0 "While Britain still considers our government to be illegitimate, Canada is a different story entirely. A treaty establishing friendship and economic ties with Canada, in addition to a pledge to help protect Canadian territory, may finally get us the attention in Europe we have been seeking."
 mex_british_french_recognition:0 "British & French Recognition"
 mex_british_french_recognition_desc:0 "Finally, Mexican diplomats that aren't rogue agents are being allowed into Europe again. With this normalization, a lot of diplomatic options are suddenly available to us, and our move to join the Entente continues."
 mex_ejercito_volutaria:0 "Ejercito Volutaria"
 mex_ejercito_volutaria_desc:0 "One major way to show support to our European allies would be to organize a volunteer expiditionary army to assist with their conflicts in Europe. This core group of volunteers will give us a stepping stone to formal entry into the conflict."
 mex_petition_america:0 "Petition the EEUU"
 mex_petition_america_desc:0 "Before we formally join a military alliance, first we must clear things up with the Yankees to ensure there are no complications with this act. Perhaps we can even convince them to give us some military assistance as we make our formal entry..."
 mex_america_entente:0 "American Entente"
 mex_america_entente_desc:0 "With the blessing and assistance of the United States, Mexico shall spearhead the Latin American cause in Europe, being the first- and most handsomely paid- line against the German assault!" 
 mex_latin_american_primacy:0 "Latin American Primacy"
 mex_latin_american_primacy_desc:0 "Mexico was the first Latin American country to achieve independence and was, for a while at least, the political, cultural, and economic torch-bearer for all of the old Spanish colonies. Our miraculous survival of the Civil War may give us the prestige necessary to take that role again."
 mex_pact_with_colombia:0 "Pact with Colombia"
 mex_pact_with_colombia_desc:0 "In Latin America, Colombia has always been Mexico's closest analogue, with a shared history and economy/military always near parity. A defensive and economic pact with Colombia gives us inroads into Latin America and gives both of us more independence from Yankee influence."
 mex_la_consolidacion:0 "La Consolidación"
 mex_la_consolidacion_desc:0 "With Central America now surrounded, it is Mexico and Colombia, not the United States, pulling the strings. To ensure no foreign puppet regimes pop up in our own backyard, let us bring Central America together as our puppet- and give Colombia their old territory back to boot." 
 mex_belize_question:0 "The Belize Question"
 mex_belize_question_desc:0 "British Honduras, also known as Belize, has been a thorn in our side since the foundation of the colony. We should open channels with the British government to negotiate a takeover. Our international image and prior relationship will decisively effect the response."
 mex_andes_friends:0 "Our friends in the Andes"
 mex_andes_friends_desc:0 "Though logically we should have similar relations with Peru as we do Colombia, we have never been quite as close for one reason or another. We should finally change this, by dealing them in to this Latin American pact, perhaps with the promise of some of the...''questions'' in the region solved with our help."
 mex_questions_remain:0 "The Questions that Remain"
 mex_questions_remain_desc:0 "Even now, there are still other issues on the continent, most notably Venezuela and the Southern Cone. At this point we have the luxury to choose our friends and our enemies, and thus, should take them case-by-case. Plus, the ''friendly administration' has proposed re-integration of Central America, if we desire."
 mex_their_portuguese_our_portuguese:0 "Their Portuguese, our Portuguese"
 mex_their_portuguese_our_portuguese_desc:0 "Brazil is an interesting player in the Latin sphere. They are easily the main power in South America, and their alliance could be useful- but they could also be a great unifying enemy. We have also received some interesting diplomatic proposals from Portugal recently which need addressing."
 mex_deal_with_diablo:0 "Deal with El Diablo"
 mex_deal_with_diablo_desc:0 "Though the Latin efforts started with the intent of parlaying into a better position with one of the major alliances, we could potentially create a new power bloc instead. Only one problem: We'd need a recognized, established power to be taken seriously, and unfortunately, there's only one real candidate..." 
 mex_making_new_friends:0 "Making New Friends"
 mex_making_new_friends_desc:0 "While we would have to take some creative measures in the event of a major war, diplomatic overtures towards our new government have already begun to arrive from Germany and Austria-Hungary. Perhaps it's time for a new diplomatic alignment in Mexico?"
 mex_austro_mexican_treaty:0 "Austro-Mexican Treaty"
 mex_austro_mexican_treaty_desc:0 "Austria and Mexico have a surprising amount of historical ties, right down to Mexico having a Hapsburg emperor for a few (unfortunate) years. Establishing economic ties would allow our economies to support each other- a nice idea, considering our countries' near opposite resource bases." 
 mex_accept_german_visitors:0 "Accept German Investors"
 mex_accept_german_visitors_desc:0 "Historically, our ties to the United States have meant German investors, by-and-large, were turned away from Mexico, keeping that money out of the economy. Those ties are no more. Let the marks flow, and let our industries grow!"
 mex_run_the_blockades:0 "Run The Blockades"
 mex_run_the_blockades_desc:0 "Adventurous Mexican sailors have been dying to take a crack at bypassing the British blockade on our friends in Central Europe. While keeping our trade lines open will be dangerous on top of angering Entente members, we could play a key role in keeping the German war effort strong."
 mex_carribean_plot:0 "Caribbean Plot"
 mex_carribean_plot_desc:0 "Britain relies heavily on her bases through the Caribbean to fight the U-Boot blockade and keep her empire's supply lines running. Even before we join the war we can allow U-Boots to station themselves here, but our generals have been forming an invasion plan to seize Entente bases in the sea."
 mex_the_rio_line:0 "The Rio Line"
 mex_the_rio_line_desc:0 "No one is under the delusion that the EEUU will stay out of the Entente forever, especially if we are to join the Central Powers. Our final act to secure ourselves before joining the war against the hated Brits should be to construct a line of fortifications on our Northern border to keep the Yankees back."
 mex_the_zimmerman_pact:0 "The Zimmerman Pact"
 mex_the_zimmerman_pact_desc:0 "Arthur Zimmerman has been lobbying for Mexico to join the Central Powers for quite some time now, and it is time we give him what he wants. Soon all of America will take our rightful territory back!"
 mex_from_the_ashes:0 "From The Ashes..."
 mex_from_the_ashes_desc:0 "Mexico is still, for the most part, in ruins, a shadow of what she was a mere two years ago. However, this presents us with some interesting opportunities to bypass traditional legal and cultural restrictions to replace what was lost with something better...if we're allowed to, at least."
 mex_comes_something_greater:0 "...Comes Something Greater"
 mex_comes_something_greater_desc:0 "With our economic independence secured, it is finally time to fulfill Porfirio's dream and turn an economy driven solely by foreign investors and controllers into an economy driven by Mexico herself. This is no nationalization campaign- we will simply outcompete them. We've won before. We'll win again."
 mex_end_of_the_hacendados:0 "End of The Hacendados"
 mex_end_of_the_hacendados_desc:0 "The Hacienda system has been in Mexico far too long, and concerningly, far too many Hacendados are part of the same investment scheme that has brought Mexico so much misery in our modernization efforts. Land shall be broken up for private use, and the Hacendados will have to find new jobs elsewhere."
 mex_agroindustria:0 "Agroidustria"
 mex_agroindustria_desc:0 "The Cientifico concept extends to more than just our industries and civic planning. Our agriculture sector, now in our own hands, needs to be modernized. Let science determine where and how we should grow, let new machines toil over the land, and let our farms and industries support each other."
 mex_mechanization_plants:0 "Mechanization Plants"
 mex_mechanization_plants_desc:0 "One place that has obvious dividends in industrial & agricultural cooperation is mechanization. Our industry can produce new machines to ramp up our farmers' collective output while providing jobs to the laborers and giving us a new export."
 mex_mexican_iron_steel:0 "Mexican Iron & Steel"
 mex_mexican_iron_steel_desc:0 "The deposits of iron in the north of the country have long been places of exploitation, with old inefficient mining setups set up to export the iron without even processing first. Rather than refitting the mines to export more raw iron, refineries should be set up to create Mexican steel."
 mex_opa_hostil:0 "OPA Hostil"
 mex_opa_hostil_desc:0 "The old companies that gave us so much trouble during our modernization process still have too much of a presence in the country, especially in our border cities. Our industry is strong enough- let us deliver the knockout punch, and perform hostile takeovers of what they have left here."
 mex_a_truly_mexican_economy:0 "A Truly Mexican Economy"
 mex_a_truly_mexican_economy_desc:0 "Every day, our cycle of resource extraction, refinement, and export becomes more and more efficient. It is time for our businessmen to take root in other countries, just as what happened to us before, and introduce the world into a truly Mexican economy, the most efficiently engineered economy there is."
 mex_cientifico_revolution:0 "Cientifico Revolucion"
 mex_cientifico_revolution_desc:0 "With the Cientifico ideology now firmly rooted in Mexico, the positive benefits of a society obsessed with technological progress is already taking root. Mexican thinkers are finally joining their European and EEUU counterparts by achieving true greatness."
 mex_yankee_secret:0 "Yankees' Secrets"
 mex_yankee_secret_desc:0 "The last 20 years of the American economy have been characterized by large-scale efficiency boosts through their factories and other workplaces. Now that our old sponsors are relying on us, let us find out what they know and integrate it into our own economy."
 mex_electrification_campaign:0 "Electrification Campaign"
 mex_electrification_campaign_desc:0 "Electrification has only truly effected Mexico City and Veracruz so far, with the civil war having put a temporary stop to the campaign to expand it. A system of power plants and power lines should be established to bring electricity to every corner of our country, to benefit both our citizens and our factories."
 mex_mexican_automobiles:0 "Mexican Automobiles"
 mex_mexican_automobiles_desc:0 "The new automobile craze sweeping the world has been, to this point, mostly restricted to Germany, Italy, and the United States, with other countries only taking a keynote interest. Let us establish a Mexican presence in this new market, to show the world that Mexico is leading the charge into the future."
 mex_liga_de_la_hidera:0 "Liga de la Hidera"
 mex_liga_de_la_hidera_desc:0 "One of the key strengths the United States has is a world-class system of higher education, most notably the Ivy League, where the greatest minds of our generation are cultivated. It is not as if their intellect is unique. Patterning some universities on the same standard would give our people a similar chance." 
 mex_encourage_youth:0 "Encourage Youth"
 mex_encourage_youth_desc:0 "The average Juanito or Juanita is the only part of our population not hooked on the Cientifico lifestyle. Building more schools, making youth education mandatory, and pushing them to cultivate a love for knowledge and respect for great thinkers will grant us a generation of geniuses." 
 mex_the_fruits_of_our_labor:0 "The Fruits of Our Labor"
 mex_the_fruits_of_our_labor_desc:0 "The seeds that Porfirio Diaz planted have sprouted into a truly impressive tree. The Mexican economy has been accepted by our contemporaries as a major world economy, and our research-obsessed culture has pushed us further forward. Let the people enjoy the fruits of our labor."
 mex_agrigola_cientifico:0 "Agricola Cientifico"
 mex_agrigola_cientifico_desc:0 "Our agricultural reforms are finally seeing adoption through even the poorest farmlands in Mexico, but we can't stop here. Expanding our Liga de la Hidera to cover agriculture as a serious science and inviting foreign thinkers to set the stage will ensure we are innovating, rather than imitating, future developments."
 mex_mexi_pharma:0 "Mexi-pharma"
 mex_mexi_pharma_desc:0 "With Latin America firmly in our economic sphere now, we have the opportunity to funnel several medicinal plants and chemicals into Mexico. With this, we can begin our own domestic drug production on a mass scale, a lucrative and highly Cientifico market."
 mex_the_best_revenge:0 "The Best Revenge"
 mex_the_best_revenge_desc:0 "The Yankee businessmen did what they did to us out of pure greed, and have found their fortunes in our grasp now. Let the people they exploited and tormented get the best possible revenge against them: The revenge of good living."
 mex_wells_and_refineries:0 "Wells And Refineries"
 mex_wells_and_refineries_desc:0 "Oil has been found through northern Mexico, though, embarrassingly, our hostility towards foreign investment at this point has left us without all the know-how as far as extraction and refinement goes. Let us send observers to Texas in order to find out and imitate the process ourselves."
 mex_immigration_campaign:0 "Immigration Campaign"
 mex_immigration_campaign_desc:0 "Even with all of the strides Mexico has taken, most European immigrants to the Americas still prefer the States, Canada, or the Southern Cone. It is ignorance, not spite, that has caused this. Let us advertise the great new life found in Mexico from Lisbon to Moscow and attract ambitious young men to our country."
 mex_merit_means_nobility:0 "Merit Means Mobility"
 mex_merit_means_nobility_desc:0 "Even now, many places in Europe find themselves in almost a caste system, with birth determining much of the quality of your life, something the United States has exploited to great effect. Let us show the world that smart, hard workers can easily make money and a good living here, and smart, hard workers will come."
 mex_the_mexican_century:0 "The Mexican Century"
 mex_the_mexican_century_desc:0 "We are far from European conflicts, we are rich, we are smart, we have resources to spare, and our country is growing every day. If one might call the 1800s the ''British Century'', then let everyone call the 1900s the Mexican Century, as we further ride the path to greatness."
 mex_get_back_to_work:0 "Get Back To Work!"
 mex_get_back_to_work_desc:0 "One of the most important ways to rebuild after the chaos of attempted revolution is to simply restore the status quo. Many of the farms, stores, mines, and factories in the north are still closed, and helping the locals open back up would get a leg up on reconstruction." 
 mex_ferrocarilles_del_norte:0 "Ferrocarilles del Norte"
 mex_ferrocarilles_del_norte_desc:0 "One issue we found the hard way in the course of the war was and is how difficult the north of the country is to control, largely due to a lack of infrastructure north of Zacatecas. Constructing new railways to link up the north will help keep order and further economically integrate the region."
 mex_civic_restoration:0 "Civic Restoration"
 mex_civic_restoration_desc:0 "While you can easily open a store back up, it's a lot harder to open a smoking crater. Many insurance firms refused to cover collateral damage from the fighting, and subsidizing restoration projects in the cities would be a good way to return to normal...and we always have a chance to leave a little more than we found." 
 mex_but_just_in_case:0 "But Just In Case..."
 mex_but_just_in_case_desc:0 "One other major factor hindering us in the war was just how limited our military presence was in general, let alone in the north. Reconstruction must apply to more than just buildings: we must also begin to reconstruct our army, in case the Maderistas have another ace up their sleeve."
 mex_mondragon_armament_company:0 "Mondragon Armament Company"
 mex_mondragon_armament_company_desc:0 "General Mondragon has been tinkering with rifle designs over the past few years, though the lack of suitable industry has meant that their production has taken place offshore, a highly inefficient process. Giving the General funding would allow him to begin an arms company, and with it, native weapon production."
 mex_get_back_to_work_again:0 "Get Back To Work... Again!"
 mex_get_back_to_work_again_desc:0 "The second phase of the revolution has left both the north and the south in ruin. Once again, we will accomplish little by leaving the areas as a scarred battlefield. Get the workers back to work, and we'll get past it again." 
 mex_national_bureau_for_reconstruction:0 "Found the INR"
 mex_national_bureau_for_reconstruction_desc:0 "Given this is not the first time we have been forced to rebuild our nation, it would be madness not to at least apply the existing knowledge. The Instituto Nacional de Restablecimiento (INR) will funnel experienced rebuilding crewmen the resources they need to take charge of the effort."
 mex_using_the_opportunity:0 "Using The Opportunity"
 mex_using_the_opportunity_desc:0 "Just as in our last conflict, we find ourselves with the opportunity to rebuild the cities with a little more than they had before the war. The south in particular could use a new coat of paint...and buildings, and factories, and so on."
 mex_a_demon_rises:0 "...A Demon Rises"
 mex_a_demon_rises_desc:0 "Unfortunately, Diaz had to sell his soul to the landowners and businessmen who arguably were the main cause of Madero's rebellion to begin with. While the Maderistas were turned back, the future of Mexico does not look bright. Perhaps if there were a way to transition the government into someone else's hands..."
 mex_the_price_we_pay:0 "The Price We Pay"
 mex_the_price_we_pay_desc:0 "The first demand by the foreigners for their ''compensation'' is a switch from the Peso to the U.S. Dollar for ''stability reasons''. The move is allegedly supposed to be temporary, but few predict it will be short-term or particularly popular. If nothing else, at least it will help restore relations with the Yankees." 
 mex_the_new_oligarchs:0 "The New Oligarchs"
 mex_the_new_oligarchs_desc:0 "The foreign investors have begun to seep into our government in order to entrench themselves further. We can expect any future attempts to uproot them to become far more difficult, but at the very least this should slow down their constant demanding and whining."
 mex_american_investment_firms:0 "American Investment Firms"
 mex_american_investment_firms_desc:0 "If we are to be in this state, we might as well take what advantages we can over this. Allowing an influx of yet more American money will help speed up modernization and hopefully give our masters someone to bicker with instead of focusing on us."
 mex_let_them_drill:0 "Let Them Drill"
 mex_let_them_drill_desc:0 "With at least a new oil deposit a day seemingly sprouting in our territory, foreign drillers have been eager to strike the earth in Mexico. While we would likely not get the full lot of oil, their trade is essentially unknown here and we could certainly profit off of what they find."
 mex_shaking_off_the_chains:0 "Shaking Off The Chains"
 mex_shaking_off_the_chains_desc:0 "With all opposition crushed and our debts to Yankee businessmen paid off, we can finally begin to re-assert our government's position. It will take a long time to catch up to even where we were, but at least we'll live to tell the tale."
 mex_nationalization_campaign:0 "Nationalization Campaign"
 mex_nationalization_campaign_desc:0 "While Porfirio Diaz never liked the idea of nationalization, our native industries are still not on par with what the foreigners have brought to the table. Forcefully taking over businesses will hurt our foreign relations and standing, but at least we'll start to take our own destiny back."
 mex_acts_of_land_reform:0 "Acts of Land Reform"
 mex_acts_of_land_reform_desc:0 "The Haciendas are untouchable, that much is certain by now. We simply could not hold on to our grip without them. However, if nothing else, at least the new regime can curb the excesses of the Hacendados and relieve our people to some degree."
 mex_mexican_recovery_diaz:0 "Mexican Recovery"
 mex_mexican_recovery_diaz_desc:0 "The frankly shocking wealth gap is starting to close back for the first time in years, which is good progress. Rolling together a tax reform with some relief spending should be a great measure in helping ourselves out of this hole."
 mex_expand_drilling_operations:0 "Expand Drilling Operations"
 mex_expand_drilling_operations_desc:0 "With the nationalization campaign, oil was one of the only lobbies that remained untouched. Still, we can adopt the traditional Cientifico method here, and use the expertise the foreigners have given us to at least begin our own drilling alongside the outsider companies."
 mex_turismo:0 "Turismo"
 mex_turismo_desc:0 "The many rich fellows who have been to our country have returned home telling stories of Mexico's beauty, which has given us a better start to a tourism industry than any PR campaign ever could. Constructing lodging in scenic locations and playing up our history could help further that cause."
 mex_republican_values:0 "Republican Values"
 mex_republican_values_desc:0 "It is important that the people know that the group of officers who have suddenly begun organizing for a ''takeover'' are doing so because they love federalism and democracy and the republic and all that other good stuff. They're the good guys, you know?"
 mex_choosing_a_right_hand_man:0 "Choosing a Right Hand Man"
 mex_choosing_a_right_hand_man_desc:0 "One thing Porfirio Diaz never truly had was a real second in command, and the fact that he was burdened with the affairs of the entire state regularly came at a detriment. He is the most vocal in insisting his successor requires at least one more powerful figure in the Mexican government."
 mex_choose_reyes:0 "Reyes"
 mex_choose_reyes_desc:0 "Many close to the President expected Bernardo Reyes would be the next in line for his seat, though few were surprised that even when this was not the case he was not far behind it. Bernardo Reyes is a calculating politician who seeks to divide and conquer the enemies of the Cientifico movement."
 mex_keep_your_friends_close:0 "Keep Your Friends Close"
 mex_keep_your_friends_close_desc:0 "Reyes is well liked by most high-profile members of the Cientifico movement, and is a generally charismatic man. Plenty of the wheelers and dealers throughout Mexico have ties to him, which gives him a great ability to gague where government support is or isn't."
 mex_and_your_enemies_closer:0 "And Your Enemies Closer"
 mex_and_your_enemies_closer_desc:0 "With our victory against the Maderistas, pro-government blocs have popped up in the population even in areas historically in full opposition to the Porfiriato. Using these connections in addition to Reyes's connections will allow us to keep an eye out for the enemies of the state."
 mex_root_out_the_villistas_and_zapatistas:0 "Root Out Revolutionaries"
 mex_root_out_the_villistas_and_zapatistas_desc:0 "The Villistas and Zapatistas are so dedicated to the cause of destruction of our government, so Bernardo Reyes has made the decision to dedicate himself just as much to their destruction. His plan is to draw community leaders and members against the revolutionaries to help stamp them out." 
 mex_choose_de_la_barra:0 "de la Barra"
 mex_choose_de_la_barra_desc:0 "Leon de la Barra is a moderate member of the Cientifico bloc who Porfirio himself has recommended for a role in the regime. He is focused around domestic stability and has pledged to return Mexico to order once again."
 mex_cientifico_reforms:0 "Cientifico Reforms"
 mex_cientifico_reforms_desc:0 "The Cientifico political reforms that de la Barra has been touting since joining the government focus mostly on converting government and bureaucratic appointments to a more merit-based model, something the intellectual part of our population has been requesting for quite some time."
 mex_concessions_to_the_labors:0 "Concessions to the Laborers"
 mex_concessions_to_the_labors_desc:0 "While the old Cientificos were always opposed to socialist-leaning reforms, enshrining some key rights for the workers and ensuring at least basic safety and living standards at both farms and factories will satisfy most of the disgruntled would-be rebels."
 mex_a_call_for_peace:0 "A Call for Peace"
 mex_a_call_for_peace_desc:0 "Always willing to speak to emotion, Leon de la Barra has begun correspondence with community leaders across the country asking them to send a firm message to the community: We want peace first of all. If you must resist the regime, debate, not fight!"
 mex_choose_huerta:0 "Huerta"
 mex_choose_huerta_desc:0 "Victoriano Huerta was a major figure in Madero's rebellion, though in the time since he has sought to align himself back with our government. Porfirio believes that he had a falling out with the rebellion and ideologically would match our rule more, especially if we play to his interest of military equipment."
 mex_domestic_arms_industry:0 "Domestic Arms Industry"
 mex_domestic_arms_industry_desc:0 "Huerta's first priority is to subsidize the creation of localized firearm companies, in imitation of recent Spanish initiatives, giving the obvious benefit of an increase in Mexican military industry and less of a reliance on imports."
 mex_artillery_factories:0 "Artillery Factories"
 mex_artillery_factories_desc:0 "Artillery is a requirement in any modern military, yet nearly 100% of Mexico's stock is imported. Developing local artillery derivative of existing licensed models will bolster our stockpiles and give us an advantage on the battlefield few Latin American countries possess."
 mex_military_industrial_complex:0 "Military-Industrial Complex"
 mex_military_industrial_complex_desc:0 "Huerta's newest plan is far more ambitious: He believes that we should pursue a higher degree of cooperation between civilian manufacturing and our new armament sector, to try and bring mutual benefits to both sides. This will particularly help our military industry stay competitive in face of foreign competition."
 mex_choose_carranza:0 "Carranza"
 mex_choose_carranza_desc:0 "Venustiano Carranza is, to put it frankly, a member of the traditional oppositon, a former staunch supporter of Madero and critic of the Porfiriato. However, he is popular among the Maderista population and has publicly stated he would be willing to act as a mediator within the government."
 mex_carranza_amnesty:0 "Amnesty"
 mex_carranza_amnesty_desc:0 "Though the idea turns the stomachs of most members of the government, Carranza's proposition of amnesty for former Maderistas still in the country makes sense. The rebels are not evil (for the most part), simply misled, and showing mercy would likely endear the majority to our cause."
 mex_returning_the_rebels_to_the_fold:0 "Returning to the Fold"
 mex_returning_the_rebels_to_the_fold_desc:0 "Showing the rebels that not only do they have the right to return to normal life but also a right to participate in (civic) discourse will embolden them politically, but will frame us as merciful and willing to listen, likely defusing any possible future uprising before they even start."
 mex_a_constitution_of_compromise:0 "A Constitution of Compromise"
 mex_a_constitution_of_compromise_desc:0 "Carranza has proposed a new constitution limiting to some degree the powers of the central government, though not nearly to the point that Madero demanded, in addition to enshrining and legitimizing Cientifico rule. Sacrificing only a bit of power will put us first in our peoples' hearts and minds."
