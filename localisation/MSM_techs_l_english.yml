 ww1_armored_car_equipment_1_desc:0 "While the Automobile is still young technology, it is already being considered for military purposes. A design as simple as putting a machine gun on one of these new automobiles and attaching some more metal to act as armor could give us an interesting new weapon to use in battle."
 ww1_armored_car_equipment_2_desc:0 "The Armored Car is still capable of evolving. By putting our main Machine Gun into a rotating turret, we can ensure that all of our crewmen are protected, increasing the efficiency of the vehicle, and its practicality in battle."
 ww1_armored_car_equipment_3_desc:0 "As Cavalry play less and less of a role on the battlefield, Armored Cars seem to be the logical way to fill the same role in a much more safe manner. Upgrading the engine and suspension systems of our Armored Cars to give them an increase in speed and mobility may be a good way to help them in this endeavor."
 ww1_armored_car_equipment_4_desc:0 "With the Tank beginning to arrive on the battlefield, our Armored Cars may seem obsolete, but these cheaper and easier to produce models can still serve our military well. Minor upgrades to the armor of these vehicles, to be able to at least survive minor blasts, should help keep them competitive."
