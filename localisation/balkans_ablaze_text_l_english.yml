 ##0-4: Early country and state modifier events##
 balkans_ablaze.1.t:0 "Bulgarian Military Professionalism"
 balkans_ablaze.1.d:0 "Skilled people have been working hard to build up our armed forces the last few decades. Now we can enjoy the fruition of this as our Army is more powerful than ever before. Few things short of a disastrous diplomatic blunder can stand between us and our rightful share of the Balkans now!"
 balkans_ablaze.1.a:0 "Towards a Greater Bulgaria!"
 
 balkans_ablaze.2.t:0 "Economic development of the Bulgarian region"
 balkans_ablaze.2.d:0 "After the agricultural period of Ottoman suzerainty, the last few decades have seen significant investments into industry and education in Bulgaria. Now we reap those benefits as our resources are mined, our industries built, and our workers educated."
 balkans_ablaze.2.a:0 "Drop by drop - a whole lake becomes."
 
 balkans_ablaze.4.t:0 "Economic development of the Greek region"
 balkans_ablaze.4.d:0 "Since the turn of the century, we've seen a steady economic growth here in Greece. Small industries and businesses has been established in Athens and other significant cities. For instance the last years have seen an expansion in textile industry, and our fishing is doing well enough. There's also some lumber industries and mines in the northernmost Greek inhabited lands which merit some expansion."
 balkans_ablaze.4.a:0 "Naught without labor."
 
 ##5-14: Army modifiers applied for/in war##
 balkans_ablaze.5.t:0 "Bulgarian Nationalistic Fervor on the rise"
 balkans_ablaze.5.d:0 "We now find ourselves in quite a lopsided and risky war, but the common Bulgarian soldier have been smitten by the patriotic promises of a \"Velika Bŭlgariya\" as promised by the Treaty of San Stefano. Could this even the score again?"
 balkans_ablaze.5.a:0 "We will prevail!"
 
 balkans_ablaze.6.t:0 "The Bulgarian Army is plagued by deserters and revolts!"
 balkans_ablaze.6.d:0 "Seeing large losses for limited gains has seen common soldiers and officers deserting our cause, and even revolting against their high command. The tenacity and morale of our armed forces have taken a significant hit."
 balkans_ablaze.6.a:0 "Hopefully, we will prevail..."
 
 balkans_ablaze.7.t:0 "The Balkan League Mobilizes"
 balkans_ablaze.7.d:0 "The Southern Balkan nations are united and ready to face their foes. We should ensure our troops are well equipped and ready to fight from the moment war breaks out. We'll do our part!"
 balkans_ablaze.7.a:0 "We'll be ready for what comes."
 
 balkans_ablaze.8.t:0 "The Black Mountain's Finest"
 balkans_ablaze.8.d:0 "Once more we find ourselves at war with the Turks. The fierceness and bravery of our warriors has often defeated the Ottoman forces before through ambushing them in our mountain valleys. We shall now let the fierceness of old and the innovations of the current be molded into one impressive fighting force as we drive the Turks back alongside our allies!"
 balkans_ablaze.8.a:0 "Attack!"
 
 balkans_ablaze.9.t:0 "The Modern Hellenic Army"
 balkans_ablaze.9.d:0 "The disaster of 1897 proved that our armies were not adequate. After this significant resources and foreign experts have been put to the task of improving the Hellenic Army. Now we finally see the results of this in our tenacious, well drilled troops, as well as a vastly improved mobilization system."
 balkans_ablaze.9.a:0 "Let them come... Should they dare."
 
 balkans_ablaze.10.t:0 "Serbian Fighting Spirit"
 balkans_ablaze.10.d:0 "The Serbians have always been a proud warrior people, testing our mettle both against the Turks, and for them when under their suzerainty. But now this proud tradition can be seen once more after testing our mettle in the recent Balkan conflict. And maybe this revival of our old fighting spirit happened just in time, with tensions on the rise in the world..."
 balkans_ablaze.10.a:0 "Good, it will be needed."
 
 balkans_ablaze.11.t:0 "Aquiring Modern Armaments"
 balkans_ablaze.11.d:0 "With the Italian invasion of Libya and the Dodecanese Islands, as well as the united Balkan League, it has become clear that the current Ottoman Military does not possess the capabilities to defend such widespread territories. As we have a good relationship with the German Empire, we could petition them for some new armament shipments to bolster our forces."
 balkans_ablaze.11.a:0 "Yes, petition the German Empire for large armament shipments."
 balkans_ablaze.11.b:0 "No, we can't afford that. Domestic weapons and current arms imports will have to do..."
 
 balkans_ablaze.12.t:0 "The First Armament shipments have arrived"
 balkans_ablaze.12.d:0 "The weapons we ordered from the German Empire have started to arrive. Mainly composed of modern German artillery pieces, this should drastically improve the firepower of our forces."
 balkans_ablaze.12.a:0 "Good. Since we're at war it would probably be prudent to increase our conscription levels as well"
 balkans_ablaze.12.b:0 "Good. These weapons should be enough for us to protect ourselves."
 
 balkans_ablaze.13.t:0 "The Last Armament shipments are here"
 balkans_ablaze.13.d:0 "The last batch of the artillery pieces and rifles we ordered from the German Empire have arrived. With all these weapons we should be able to field an impressive army."
 balkans_ablaze.13.a:0 "Excellent. We may yet protect our Rumelian holdings"
 balkans_ablaze.13.b:0 "Maybe if they'd been here earlier..."
 
 balkans_ablaze.14.t:0 "The Ottoman Empire wants to buy German Armaments"
 balkans_ablaze.14.d:0 "While we've already got deals and a good relationship with the Ottoman Empire, their recent war with Italy over Libya and the precarious position of Rumelia have suddenly left them wanting for a more powerful Army capable of defending their sprawling territories. As such they're looking to buy many of our modern and semi modern weapons to equip their forces. While they've purchased guns and artillery from us before, this would be at a very large scale. Their ambassadors claim they'll pay us well."
 balkans_ablaze.14.a:0 "Of course we will sell armaments to our friends in need."
 balkans_ablaze.14.b:0 "We must decline this deal."
 
 ##15-19: First Balkan War (and immediate aftermath)##
 balkans_ablaze.15.t:0 "Our grip on the Balkans is slipping"
 balkans_ablaze.15.d:0 "Unfortunately, it would seem our Empire is in quite the decline with the British seizing Egypt, Italy attacking Libya, and the Balkan nations banding together and defeating us.\n\nNow that the Montenegrin, Serb, Bulgarian, and Greek populations have joined their respective ethnic states, it'd be hard to reintegrate these areas. Maybe a more pragmatic foreign policy aimed at retaking bordering regions would be more appropriate. The Eastern Aegean Islands and Eastern Thrace seem like good candidates. So does Cyprus and Kuwait should we ever find ourselves in a favourable war with Britain..."
 balkans_ablaze.15.a:0 "Pragmatism seems appropriate. If we are to keep our Empire, this decline must be stopped or reversed!"
 
 balkans_ablaze.16.t:0 "The Turks are losing their grip on the Balkans"
 balkans_ablaze.16.d:0 "After their defeat in the recent War in the Balkans, the Turks have lost their grip on most of their former territory and the people living there, as they rejoice to once more be part of their respective ethnic states. Maybe this will signify a shift in their foreing policy to opportunistic reclamation of bordering territories instead? While the Montenegrin and Serbian states now have buffer states between them and the Turks, the Bulgarian and Greek Kingdoms still border the wounded, but powerful Empire."
 balkans_ablaze.16.a:0 "Yes, yes. We'll all be careful. Now however, we celebrate!"
 
 ##20-39: Second Balkan War (and immediate aftermath)##
 balkans_ablaze.20.t:0 "The Montenegrins back out"
 balkans_ablaze.20.d:0 "The Second Balkan war might be the greatest threat to our nation yet. Having to fight the former Balkan League could have proven disastrous, and the Montenegrins, though limited in number, are very competent warriors.\n\nLuckily, as we managed to defend our lands and push into Serbian held Macedonia, the Montenegrins saw that this war was not worth losing more Montenegrin lives to them. They've accepted peace with us, and have switched focus to the integration of their new territories instead. Now to deal with the Serbs and Greeks once and for all."
 balkans_ablaze.20.a:0 "Every bit helps, and peace with the People of the Black Mountain is an important bit."
 
 balkans_ablaze.21.t:0 "Peace with [From.GetName]"
 balkans_ablaze.21.d:0 "While it initially seemed like the Bulgarians had let their power and ambitions go to their head, the fact that they're currently winning and advancing have shown the futility of taking Serbia's side here. Our leaders have sued for peace with Bulgaria. The Serbs will have to fight their own war from now on."
 balkans_ablaze.21.a:0 "It's not like we had anything to gain from fighting Bulgaria anyways."
 
 balkans_ablaze.22.t:0 "The Romanians defeated"
 balkans_ablaze.22.d:0 "The Second Balkan war might be the greatest threat to our nation yet. Having to fight the former Balkan League and the Romanians in the North could have proven disastrous.\n\nLuckily, as we managed to defend our lands and push into Romanian territory, the Romanians have now sued for peace and given up their claims to Southern Dobrudzha, including the port city of Silistra and its fortress. In addition to this we have forced them to cede the small parts of Dobrudzha promised to us by the Treaty of San Stefano. We have been quite lenient, however, by letting them keep all of their populous cities and towns in Dobrudzha, only taking the small port town of Mangaliya. Now to deal with out former friends."
 balkans_ablaze.22.a:0 "The situation is looking much better."
 
 balkans_ablaze.23.t:0 "Peace with [From.GetName]"
 balkans_ablaze.23.d:0 "While it initially seemed like the Bulgarians had let their power and ambitions go to their head, the fact that they're currently winning on their northern front, and even occupying our territory have lead us to believe otherwise. Our leaders have therefore sued for peace with the Bulgarians. The Serbs will have to handle this themselves, since it's clearly not in our interest anymore. We've given up our claim on the Quadrilateral, or Southern Dobrogea, as well as the small port town of Mangalia to get off without further losses."
 balkans_ablaze.23.a:0 "Southern Dobrogea we can live without... Bessarabia and Transylvania are the real prizes."
 
 balkans_ablaze.24.t:0 "The Turks defeated"
 balkans_ablaze.24.d:0 "The Second Balkan war might be the greatest threat to our nation yet. Having to fight the former Balkan League and the Turks in the East could have proven disastrous. Luckily, as we managed to defend our lands and push into Turkish territory once more, the Turks have sued for peace and given up their claims to their former territory in Bulgarian Thrace. Now to deal with out former \"friends\"."
 balkans_ablaze.24.a:0 "The situation may yet be salvaged."
 
 balkans_ablaze.25.t:0 "Peace with [From.GetName]"
 balkans_ablaze.25.d:0 "While it initially seemed like the Bulgarians had let their power and ambitions go to their head, the fact that they're currently winning on their eastern front, and even occupying our territory have lead us to believe otherwise. Our leaders have therefore sued for peace with the Bulgarians. The Serbs will have to handle this themselves, since it's clearly not in our interest anymore."
 balkans_ablaze.25.a:0 "We'll have to find recompense for our losses elsewhere. Maybe the North Aegean Islands make a better target?"
 
 balkans_ablaze.26.t:0 "The Greeks have offered us a deal"
 balkans_ablaze.26.d:0 "The Greeks do not want to give up Thessalonika, but have finally realized they're beaten. They've offered to give up their claims to all of Bulgarian Thrace, as well as peace and a non-aggression pact if we let them keep Thessalonika. While Bulgarian patriots covet Solun and \"Velika Bŭlgariya\", maybe it's time to be pragmatic and focus on the Serbians?"
 balkans_ablaze.26.a:0 "Let's have peace with the Greeks, the Serbs are the ones holding what we're after."
 balkans_ablaze.26.b:0 "Why choose peace when war is about is about to give us Greater Bulgaria?"
 
 balkans_ablaze.27.t:0 "[From.GetName] agreed to peace"
 balkans_ablaze.27.d:0 "The Bulgarians, though initially outnumbered, managed to get the better of us to the extent where we had to sue for peace. Since the Bulgarians are still busy, we've gotten to keep our recently taken lands, by renouncing our claims to Bulgarian Thrace and signing a pact of peace, friendship and continued trade."
 balkans_ablaze.27.a:0 "The Bulgarians are someone else's problem now. Well, presumably the Serbs'."
 
 balkans_ablaze.28.t:0 "[From.GetName] refused our generous peace offer"
 balkans_ablaze.28.d:0 "The Bulgarians, who surprisingly managed to get the upper hand on us in this war, have refused our generous peace offer. They're apparently obsessed with the idea of the Greater Bulgaria concept, calling for all of Macedonia. While war support has taken a solid hit at home, we have little choice but to continue the fight."
 balkans_ablaze.28.a:0 "Their greed knows no bounds. The Turkish yoke apparently makes way for the Bulgarian yoke."
 
 balkans_ablaze.29.t:0 "A Surprising Defeat"
 balkans_ablaze.29.d:0 "The Bulgarians have actually managed beat all of their neighbors, including us, their initial target. While their diplomacy and behavior can be called nothing but crude, their Military seems to be the antipole to their diplomacy, a well managed and finely tuned entity. We have no choice but to sue for peace along with the remnants of the nations initially opposing the Bulgarians.\n\nAt least we'll keep some of our gains from the First of these Wars in the Balkans."
 balkans_ablaze.29.a:0 "Macedonia is theirs, but they could have had it without this bloodshed if they'd just supported our claim to Northern Albania earlier..."
 
 balkans_ablaze.30.t:0 "A Tremendous Victory"
 balkans_ablaze.30.d:0 "The Serbs and their backstabbing allies are beaten. Macedonia is ours, Greater Bulgaria has been all but accomplished, and the Romanians and Turks have been forced to give up their claims on our territory forever, grateful that we didn't pursue further territorial gains on their countries.\n\nFinally we've also required the Serbs to pay war reparations to ensure they stay weakened, and can never again keep the Bulgarian people from staying united. The Austrians have also finally stopped meddling in our affairs, allowing us to keep our gains."
 balkans_ablaze.30.a:0 "Long Live the Tsar, and God bless Velika Bŭlgariya!"
 
 balkans_ablaze.40.t:0 "Bulgaro-Serbian Tensions"
 balkans_ablaze.40.d:0 "The pieces have fallen into place, one by one, first there were tensions about giving credit to the Serbians that helped Bulgarians with their part of the burden in the Balkan War, which led to distrust between Serbia and Bulgaria. Then the Serbs were denied Albania by the major powers after atrocities were committed during the Balkan War. Thusly Serbia sought to keep non-agreed on parts of Macedonia from Bulgaria. The Bulgarians are now outraged, and war may erupt. Now where do the Montenegrin people and Government stand on such an issue?"
 balkans_ablaze.40.a:0 "The Bulgarians are right, the Serbs have denied them their territory. In fact, we should get more too!"
 balkans_ablaze.40.b:0 "We are done intervening, we have our own territory to integrate."
 balkans_ablaze.40.c:0 "The Serbians were nice enough in their terms. Send the Bulgarian Government an ultimatum that we'll oppose their antics!"
 
 balkans_ablaze.43.t:0 "A Call to Arms from [BUL.GetNameDef]"
 balkans_ablaze.43.d:0 "The [BUL.GetAdjectiveCap]'s now find themselves in a war against [SER.GetNameDef] for their claims in Macedonia. With us siding with them diplomatically they'd apparently hoped we'd now step in with force too. There will probably be some small gains for us too if this results in a [BUL.GetAdjectiveCap] victory. How shall we respond?"
 balkans_ablaze.43.a:0 "We're in, man the borders!"
 balkans_ablaze.43.b:0 "Not now (they will not be able to ask again until §Y60 days§! have passed)."
 MTN_sided_with_bulgaria_because:0 "[MTN.GetNameDefCap] backs [BUL.GetNameDef]'s Claims to Macedonia"
 
 balkans_ablaze.44.t:0 "[MTN.GetNameDefCap] accepts the Call to Arms"
 balkans_ablaze.44.d:0 "[MTN.GetName] backs the Bulgarian claims to Macedonia to the extent they've joined the war on the Bulgarian side. Now they too fight for the Bulgarian side!"
 balkans_ablaze.44.a:0 "Excellent. Let's prepare for a joint strike!"
 balkans_ablaze.44.b:0 "Most helpful."
 balkans_ablaze.44.c:0 "Blast. What have these people been plotting?"
 
 balkans_ablaze.45.t:0 "[MTN.GetNameDefCap] rejects the Call to Arms, for now"
 balkans_ablaze.45.d:0 "[MTN.GetName] did not find the current situation on the ground to their liking. They've rejected our call to arms for now, and we may not ask again until at least §Y60 days§! have passed."
 balkans_ablaze.45.a:0 "So we're on our own... Let's prepare for a grand defense!"
 balkans_ablaze.45.b:0 "Most unsatisfactory... For now at least."
 BAL_nothing_happens_tt:0 "Nothing happens."
 
 balkans_ablaze.60.t:0 "Purchasing Farman III airplanes from [FRA.GetName]"
 balkans_ablaze.60.d:0 "Aerial reconnaissance and dropping explosives from airplanes could be the next big arena for warfare. The French have recently been pioneering this new craft, and they've taken to training pilots and delivering planes to certain high bidding countries. The Farman III, also known as the Albatros F-2, then being among the most well regarded of these pioneering aircraft. Then it might stand to reason that we here in [Root.GetName] should get in on this too. Should we place an order for some of these new marvels of engineering?"
 balkans_ablaze.60.a:0 "We'll take §Ya dozen§! of these Farman III airplanes!"
 balkans_ablaze.60.b:0 "For us, §Yhalf a dozen§! of these Farman III airplanes will do."
 balkans_ablaze.60.c:0 "We'll spend enough for §Ythree§! Farman III airplanes only."
 balkans_ablaze.60.p:0 "On second thought, we won't buy any Farman III airplanes right now..."
 
 balkans_ablaze.61.t:0 "Selling Farman III airplanes to [From.GetName]"
 balkans_ablaze.61.d:0 "Aerial reconnaissance and dropping explosives from airplanes could be the next big arena for warfare. Since we've recently been pioneering this new craft, and we've also taken to training pilots and delivering planes to certain high bidding countries, it's obvious From.GetName is looking to become one of our said customers now. Henri Farman's Farman III airplane, also known as the Albatros F-2, maybe the most well regarded model of them all, is what they're looking to purchase [?Root.ba_airplane_amount|Y0] of now. Should we agree to fulfill this order of [?Root.ba_airplane_amount|Y0] of these new marvels of engineering for them?"
 balkans_ablaze.61.a:0 "Oui, c'est acceptable. They can have some of our planes, as long as they pay."
 balkans_ablaze.61.b:0 "Non, c'est inacceptable. They can't have our planes right now."
 
 balkans_ablaze.62.t:0 "[From.GetName] agrees to sell us Farman III airplanes"
 balkans_ablaze.62.d:0 "Just as we'd hoped, the French have agreed to sell us [?Root.ba_airplane_amount|Y0] Farman III airplanes like we ordered. Our enemies best watch their backs, and for that matter their aboves. Now we just need to wait for the planes being readied and delivered to us."
 balkans_ablaze.62.a:0 "The sky is not the limit!"
 
 balkans_ablaze.63.t:0 "The planes from [FRA.GetName] have arrived!"
 balkans_ablaze.63.d:0 "The [?Root.ba_airplane_amount|Y0] Farman III airplanes we ordered from [FRA.GetName] are finally here! These marvels of engineering will surely show the world that [Root.GetName] is at the world forefront of technological advancements."
 balkans_ablaze.63.a:0 "Great. Let's bring them into storage people, we want them ready for action."
 
 balkans_ablaze.64.t:0 "[From.GetName] rejects to sell us Farman III airplanes"
 balkans_ablaze.64.d:0 "Unfortunately, the French have rejected to sell us our desired [?Root.ba_airplane_amount|Y0] units of Farman III airplanes like we'd ordered. Our enemies will have to be vanquished on the ground and on the Seas still for now."
 balkans_ablaze.64.a:0 "Ooof, that's a disappointing message they've winged us."
 
 ##150-199: Non-Balkan events, historical##
 balkans_ablaze.150.t:0 "Forces of [GER.GetNameDef] are crossing our borders"
 balkans_ablaze.150.d:0 "[GER.GetNameDefCap] has sent troops across our border in a bid to further their war efforts agains [FRA.GetNameDef]. They seem poised to leave our country under some sort of military occupation unless we act immediately. How shall we respond?"
 balkans_ablaze.150.a:0 "We must accept this for now. Maybe time will see [ROOT.GetName] independent again..."
 balkans_ablaze.150.b:0 "Try to buy them off with military access and favourable diplomacy."
 balkans_ablaze.150.c:0 "Let's immediately join [FRA.GetNameDef] and see if the situation can be salvaged."
 
 balkans_ablaze.155.t:0 "The French Army Staff"
 balkans_ablaze.155.d:0 "Recent developments among the Army Staff as well as the current situation with enemies at the gates and large forces to be administered calls for a unified High Command and finding the best possible commanders for the job. Parts of the high ranking Army Staff with the likes of Joseph Jacques Césaire Joffre have now stepped up to the plate to command our troops in this time of need."
 balkans_ablaze.155.a:0 "Aux arms hommes!"
 
 balkans_ablaze.156.t:0 "Lord Kitchener's Plan"
 balkans_ablaze.156.d:0 "While we find ourselves in a big war, an important opposition to the notion that our troops will be home by this Christmas or the next one, is the current Secretary of State for War, Lord Horatio Herbert Kitchener. Lord Kitchener argues that the British Army is currently way to small for prolonged conflict, and that the territorial force would be pretty much useless if sent into battle. Instead of immediate deployment for the cause, he wants to use said force to train an impressive 70 divisions, enabling us to rival the likes of the European land powers of France and Germany. Already recruitment posters are being drawn up to encourage more volunteers, and should that not be enough, the hitherto unthinkable option of conscription could even be considered. Whatever happens, there's a distinct possibility that the British Army could reach its largest size ever at this rate."
 balkans_ablaze.156.a:0 "To arms lads!"
 
 ##1020-1099: Various mod-test events##
 balkans_ablaze.1020.t:0 "Mod-test event - Threat Levels"
 balkans_ablaze.1020.d:0 "For the current tag you can add to or subtract from the current threat level by one. The applicable tags (original tag = ) are SER, GRE, BUL and TUR. For others this does nothing.\n\nAs an addendum, as of 1.1.1, §YThreat Levels§! do nothing important."

 ba_news.20.d:0 "Though many prominent Bulgarians were unhappy with the London Conference, they've now seemingly accepted that Greater Bulgaria will see no immediate fruition.

 ##Starting Events and Introduction##
 ba_story.0.t:0 "The Balkan Peninsula Enters the New Century"
 ba_story.0.d:0 "The lasting peace and stability brought on by the Metternich system after the Napoleonic Wars have gotten shakier and shakier, with social upheavals across Europe such as the February Revolution in 1848, new independent nations across Europe such as Greece, Serbia, Belgium, Romania, Bulgaria and Norway, limited conflicts, unified nations and national awakenings. The Balkans with the Ottoman Empire in decline have perhaps seen one of the most significant amounts of change in Europe, and certainly the situation is shaky. The Serbians and Greeks have fought several wars with the Ottoman Empire, gaining territory bit by bit, until the Ottoman defeat of Greece in 1897 put a, temporary at least, halt and reversal to some of these fortunes.\n\nThe Tsardom (or Kingdom) of Bulgaria has played the times to the best of their abilities so far, with the Treaty of Berlin in 1878 securing their de facto independence, though it replaced the since sought after terms of the Treaty of San Stefano as the Russians and Serbians were against a large Bulgaria at the time. As Bulgaria vied for Eastern Rumelia less than ten years later, the Serbs, wanting gains for themselves and encouraged by Austria-Hungary (which wanted Serb nationalism directed south, for obvious reasons), attacked Bulgaria in a bid to gain territory, but were promptly beaten back in the Serbo-Bulgarian War as the Bulgarian forces were redeployed against the new threat. Bulgaria thusly unified with the Ottoman province of Eastern Rumelia at last, but the Austrians threatening war if the Bulgarians continued advancing into Serbia prevented gains against Serbia. The Principality of Montenegro, long independent and largely indomitable, have also seen some modest gains against the Ottomans, and might just decide to elevate their state to a Kingdom if the time seems right.\n\nWhether pledging loyalty to the Austrian Emperor, the Turkish Sultan, the Romanian King, the Bulgarian Tsar, or the Russian one, the Megali idea, the Albanian cause, or other, the Balkans is a place to look out for."
 ba_story.0.a:0 "A land of conflict, but also opportunity..."
 
 ba_story.1.t:0 "The Bulgarian Tsardom at the dawn of the 1900s"
 ba_story.1.d:0 "By taking advantage of Ottoman instability and struggles between Great Powers (like the Austro-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia), Bulgaria has just recently elevated itself from a Principality to a Tsardom in October of 1908, shortly following the de jure integration of Eastern Rumelia into the Princedom. With this, Bulgaria has solidly cemented its status as an independent nation state. Indeed, opportunism might be the name of the game in the Balkans as developments happen quickly and erratically. And for the Bulgarian Tsardom, there is still much to do...\n\nIn addition to rapid industrialization, common education and population growth, one of the advantages the modern Bulgarian state has is its well developed Armament Industry, with Sofia Artillery Arsenal at the center of it all. While this should benefit the Bulgarian Military immensely, it might just be needed for whatever struggles lie ahead."

Now, it's one of the most competent armament producers in the Balkans, equipping the Bulgarian Army with a plethora of guns and artillery pieces."

 BUL_bulgarian_army_staff:0 "Bulgarian Army Staff"
 BUL_bulgarian_army_staff_desc:0 "The Bulgarian Army Staff has recently been expanded, with officers receiving training across Europe. With modern expertize the Bulgarian Army has aquired not only tactical and strategical insights, but also a balloon reconnaissance force, new guns, and not least, officers that understand their trade. The large scale tactics, movements and drafts of the Bulgarian Army are thusly generally well thought out."
 TUR_ottoman_army_staff:0 "Ottoman Army Staff"
 TUR_ottoman_army_staff_desc:0 "The Ottoman Empire has certainly seen some serious decline in the last few centuries, against both old adversaries, and new, such as the Austrian Empire, the Russian Empire, the Persian Empire, and more recently the Egyptian rebellion, the French and the British. Of course, a prestigious and Sublime State such as the Ottoman Empire should not go down willingly, and the 1800s have seen some serious, and often successful attempts at turning this troublesome downward spiral around. The first was the auspicious incident of June 1826, where the by then decadent and greedy Janissaries were thrown out as an institution altogether, though they did not go down without one last rebellion against the Sultan. Since then, instead of forced Christian convert soldiers (though with the later privileges, maybe it wasn't forced for all at that point?), the Ottoman Army has been made up of able and willing Muslim soldiers instead. Indeed, after modernizing with the French Army as a role model, during the Crimean War the Ottoman troops could finally hold their own against the Russian ones, once more earning the Ottoman Empire's soldiers the reputation of a decent fighting force, and also winning said war alongside France and the United Kingdom.\n\nHowever, as the Franco-Prussian War concluded, the now adaptable Ottoman administration started looking to the German and British Armed Forces for inspiration instead, as France had been shown to not necessarily be the pinnacle of the modern European armies. While these bold reforms seem to have paid off so far, are they happening fast enough to save the Empire from those who would seek to end it?"
 FRA_french_army_staff:0 "French Army Staff"
 FRA_french_army_staff_desc:0 "The modern French Army Staff know to base their ideas and plans on rational judgements of potential conflicts and their possible developments, but they're not entirely immune to influence from more abstract ideals either, such as the ideal of Élan, and maybe more crass but certainly not to be ignored, Revanchism. While it is true that since the 1870s and 1880s the French public has somewhat diminished in its uproar to get Alsace-Lorraine back, it still lingers there somewhat, and the revanchism could be reignited should the right happenstance occur. While the French Army Staff are influenced by both traditions, sciences, observance of other conflicts of the time, politicians and the public, within there are also disagreements, whether they be over uniforms or effective fighting. But, indeed, isn't there some strength and innate innovativeness in some discourse? Whatever may happen, the French Army's soldiers will fight hard should the situation demand it, and the French High Command almost always demands it as well."

 BUL_ferdinand_i_DESC:0 "Born Ferdinand Maximilian Karl Leopold Maria of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Ferdinand was born on the 26th of February 1861, in Vienna. Then a German Prince of a German and Hungarian noble family branch, he was baptized as such in St. Stephen's Cathedral. He grew up in a cosmopolitan setting among Austro-Hungarian nobility.\n\nWhen then Knyaz (Prince) of Bulgaria Alexander of Battenberg had abdicated in 1887 after a pro-Russian coup (having ruled only 7 years), Ferdinand, then an officer of the Austro-Hungarian Army was elected Knyaz of autonomous Bulgaria by its Grand National Assembly on the 7th of July 1887. While many detractors, even Queen Victoria herself (whom he was related to) found him unfit, and in Victoria's own words, eccentric and delicate, he generally did well for the following decades. Stefan Stambolov, the leader of the Liberal Party, did cool the relations with Russia during this period, but this turned around again after his death in 1894.\n\nThen, on October 5th 1908, Ferdinand proclaimed Bulgaria's de jure independence from the Ottoman Empire. He also proclaimed Bulgaria a Kingdom, and assumed the title of Tsar in a nod to the Bulgarian rulers of old. Thus the Tsardom of Bulgaria came to be. The declaration was proclaimed by him at the Holy Forty Martyrs Church in Tarnovo, and both the Ottoman Empire and the other European powers recognized the declaration. The smoothness with which this went through may have largely been due to the fact that Bulgaria was already de facto independent."

 VICTORY_POINTS_6680:0 "Bregenz"
 VICTORY_POINTS_9598:0 "Trient"         ### Using German/Austrian name for now. Let Italy rename by decision if owner of the state?
 VICTORY_POINTS_9630:0 "Bozen"          ### Was Bozen rather than Botzen in 1891 already on at least some maps, so that's what we're going with.
 VICTORY_POINTS_9665:0 "Linz"
 VICTORY_POINTS_11735:0 "Pola"          ### Main naval base of the Austro-Hungarian navy. Grew rapidly since the decision was made in 1859 by Hans Dahlerup, a Danish admiral in the service of Austria.
 VICTORY_POINTS_6562:0 "Olmütz"
 VICTORY_POINTS_6576:0 "Zlin"           ### Small town, but remarkably fast growing and prosperous. Supplied arms for the Austro-Hungarian Army. Worth 1 VP for those reasons combined.

 VICTORY_POINTS_11622:0 "Gyulafehérvár"
 VICTORY_POINTS_3617:0 "Újvidék"        ### Going with German names for Cisleithania and Hungarian names for Transleithania unless a large number of Germans lived in the particular city (for example: Pressburg). Bosnia gets Croatian, Bosnian or Serbian names probably.
 VICTORY_POINTS_3614:0 "Pancsova"       ### An Austro-Hungarian city/town so close to Belgrade that it was practically a district of it (on the other side of the border). Hungarian name used here.
 VICTORY_POINTS_9606:0 "Temesvár"       ### Large multi ethnic city in the Banat region, home to Germans, Hungarians, Serbs and Romanians. Grew very fast around 1910.
 VICTORY_POINTS_3943:0 "Zadar"          ### Called both Zadar and Zara at the time. Aquired its current form during the time of the Austrian Empire and A-H Empire, and this was also based on the older names. Still named Zadar today.
 VICTORY_POINTS_9588:0 "Banja Luka"
 VICTORY_POINTS_9894:0 "Mostar"         ### Decently sized city in Bosnia which had grown bigger and rather important culturally during the later stages of the Ottoman period. The Austro-Hungarian period brought on rapid modernisation.
 VICTORY_POINTS_11572:0 "Zenica"
 
 # Cities/places in Italy
 VICTORY_POINTS_603:0 "Verona"          ### Large city close to the border zone of Italy against the Austro-Hungarian Empire. If they're at war, this should give the border skirmishes and battles some more flavor and something important to fight for.

 VICTORY_POINTS_6940:0 "Novi Pazar"

 VICTORY_POINTS_11868:0 "Pirot"         ### A mainly Bulgarian inhabited region/town that came under Serbia anyways as the Serbians and others complained about the Treaty of San Stefano, thus leading to the Treaty of Berlin instead. This was probably one difference the Bulgarians and Serbians would have to put aside before their cooperation in the Balkan League. While Morava also had significant numbers of Bulgarians, we limit the Bulgarian cores to just Pirot for now, as that was where they had a clear majority.
 
 # Cities/places in Bulgaria

 VICTORY_POINTS_6842:0 "Tarnovo"        ### Historically important city of Bulgaria. Where Ferdinand I proclaimed Bulgaria's de jure independence in 1908, which further emphasized this. Just named Tarnovo back then before later getting its honorary 'Veliko' added before the name.
 VICTORY_POINTS_6857:0 "Gorna Dzhumaya" ### Back then a Bulgarization of Turkish Yukarı Cuma; 'Gorna Dzhumaya' means 'Upper Dzhumaya' in Bulgarian. Renamed Blagoevgrad in 1950. 'Lower Dzhumaya' is a district of Ser/Serres/Sérres.
 VICTORY_POINTS_9612:0 "Ruse"           ### Where Sofia Artillery Arsenal was located before it moved and became known as Sofia Artillery Arsenal.

 VICTORY_POINTS_849:0 "Gelibolu"        ### Third largest city in the Adrianople Vilayet, after Tekfurdağı and Odrin/Edirne/Adrianople itself (as of 1905). Also important to represent with the historical invasion by the British Empire and their Dominions in 1915.
 VICTORY_POINTS_11829:0 "Üsküdar"       ### Old, historical district of Constantinople, both in the Greek and Ottoman period, on the Asian side of the strait.
